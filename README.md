# 🧮 Customer Churn Analysis – SQL Project

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze customer churn, retention, revenue trends, and customer lifetime value (LTV) using SQL.

This project highlights SQL skills needed for data analyst roles: joins, aggregations, window functions, and cohort analysis.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
Three relational tables created via SQL:

- **customers** – customer profile & signup dates  
- **subscriptions** – start & end dates (used for churn logic)  
- **transactions** – revenue per customer  

Dataset generated manually using INSERT statements (included in the project).
